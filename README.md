## About The Project

Developed to share the author's writings, experiences and stories. During the development phase, I took care to be dynamic. Because it developed by custom designing for one person's experiences and writings. It was a project that I had a lot of fun while developing and found new tricks. I hope you have fun exploring.

## Basic Development Principles

Used the design architecture n-tier architecture. Minimized the dependencies to make the code manageable. Developed it by avoiding repetitive topics. Focused on performance optimizations using fast and efficient queries and asynchronous methods.
